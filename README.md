For now I'm actually happy with where things are at. There is still styling I
want to take care of but overall the database seems to work as intended. I'll
have to play around a little bit to figure out how to maybe get a comments
section going and I'd like to figure out how to add a delete button to each
indivdual post rather than ask the user to specify the id of the post they
wish to remove. A button in the top right corner of the post with a trash bin
icon would be kind of cool I think (I'm not quite sure how to implement this
idea yet).

I'd also like to make it so the idividual blog posts are seperated into
expandable boxes (also don't know how to implement this) show only the comments
associated with the post being currently viewed. It would also be nice if I can
figure out how to expand the textbox used to type the blog when it is being
actively used (Some practive I've had with stlying links at least gives me
some ideas as to how to start). 

Now I have no idea what to do with my original design though where I had
included ideas for a nav bar and "other blog channels". The nav bar currently
links to other websites as a placeholder for later ideas and all the
unimplemented divs contain Lorem ipsum for now.

I also still need to figure out how to sanatize my inputs for the database
manipulation. I didn't do that in the previous assignment and I don't think
its neccessary for this assignment but given that all the other SQL stuff
currently in place was given to me, it'd be cool and useful to figure out
sanitation.
